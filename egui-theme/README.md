`egui-theme` defines a common interface for serializing and storing [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui)'s style and font data for use between applications. The goal is to allow users of `egui` to easily create and share themes between relevant applications.

`egui-theme` makes no assumptions about serialization format and will support any [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde)).
